# Java Currency Converter

## Description
This program will convert the top 5 most used currencies around the world. It will start off by outputing a prompt and a list of the 5 currencies to choose from. It will then prompt the user for input and use that input to find out what conversion the user is wanting. Once we figure out the result of the inputs, it will send the result to a class as a parameter. The class it is sent to will loop through a hashmap until the result is equal to a key in the hashmap. Once the key and result are equal it will then output the key's value resulting in the conversion chosen by the user.

## Reason for project
I started this project to teach myself Java while keeping the program efficient. I used Java basics like variables, arrays, loops, and classes as well as hashmaps, scanners, abstract classes, and inheritance.
